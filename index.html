        <p>First: The Library exists ab aeterno. This truth, <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-3"><span>whose immediate corollary</span></a> is <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-7"><span>the future eternity of the world</span></a>, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind. <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-4"><span>Man, the imperfect librarian</span></a>, may be the product of chance or of <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-3"><span>malevolent demiurgi</span></a>; the universe, with its <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-6"><span>elegant endowment of shelves</span></a>, of enigmatical volumes, of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-5"><span>latrines for the seated librarian</span></a>, can only be the work of a god. To perceive the distance between the divine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols which <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-1"><span>my fallible hand scrawls</span></a> on the cover of a book, with the organic letters inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-2">
        <p>Second: <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-7"><span>The orthographical symbols</span></a> are twenty-five in number. This finding made it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library and solve satisfactorily the problem which <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-5"><span>no conjecture had deciphered: the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books</span></a>. One which my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters MCV, perversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted in this area) is <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-4"><span>a mere labyrinth of letters</span></a>, but the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids. This much is already known: for every sensible line of straightforward statement, there are <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-3"><span>leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles and incoherences</span></a>. (I know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-5"><span>in the chaotic lines of one's palm...</span></a> They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain that this <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-1"><span>application is accidental</span></a> and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)
